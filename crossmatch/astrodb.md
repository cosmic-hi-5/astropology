* **SIMBAD:** The SIMBAD database (Set of Identifications, Measurements, and Bibliography for Astronomical Data) is a comprehensive database of information about celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and various other types of astrophysical sources. It is maintained by the Centre de Donn√©es astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) in France, and is available to the public for free online. SIMBAD contains a wide range of data about celestial objects, including celestial coordinates, photometric and spectroscopic data, distances, luminosities, and other physical properties. It also includes bibliographic information about the objects, such as references to scientific papers and other published sources of data.

* **NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED):** This is a comprehensive database of information about extragalactic objects, including active galactic nuclei (AGN). You can search for AGN by name or other properties, such as celestial coordinates or redshift.

* **The Astronomy Catalog (TAC):** This is a database of astronomical objects and phenomena, including AGN, compiled from a variety of sources. You can search for AGN by name or other properties, such as celestial coordinates or redshift.

* **The VizieR Catalog Service:** This is a database of catalogs and data tables from a wide range of astronomical surveys and missions. You can search for AGN and other celestial objects by name or other properties, such as celestial coordinates or redshift.

* **The Chandra X-ray Observatory:** This is a satellite mission dedicated to studying high-energy phenomena in the universe, including AGN. The Chandra website includes a wealth of information about AGN and other celestial objects, including images and spectra.

* **Gaia:** The Gaia database, maintained by the European Space Agency (ESA), is a comprehensive database of information about celestial objects, including stars, galaxies, and other types of astrophysical sources. It is based on observations made by the Gaia spacecraft, which is a mission dedicated to mapping the positions, distances, and other properties of celestial objects in the Milky Way galaxy and beyond. Gaia contains a wealth of data about celestial objects, including celestial coordinates, photometric and spectroscopic data, distances, luminosities, and other physical properties.


## Specific to AGNs

* **The AGN catalog of Marchesini et al. (2018):** This is a comprehensive catalog of AGN based on data from a number of different surveys and missions, including the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The catalog includes information about the properties of the AGN, such as celestial coordinates, redshifts, luminosities, and other physical characteristics.

* **The Chandra Source Catalog (CSC):** This is a catalog of X-ray sources detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory, including AGN. The catalog includes information about the X-ray properties of the sources, such as their fluxes, spectra, and other characteristics.

* **The Swift/BAT 105-month AGN Catalog:** This is a catalog of AGN detected by the Swift satellite's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), based on data from 105 months of observations. The catalog includes information about the AGN, such as celestial coordinates, redshifts, and other physical properties.
